# Jetpack Compose Android App
Learn to build a Jetpack Compose Android App - Open-Source Project



<br>

## We will build and learn the following for the App State in Jetpack Compose:
* How to think about state and events in a Jetpack Compose UI.
* How Compose uses state to determine which elements to display on the screen.
* What state hoisting is.
* How stateful and stateless composable functions work.
* How Compose automatically tracks state with the State<T> API.
* How memory and internal state work in a composable function: using the remember and rememberSaveable APIs.
* How to work with lists and state: using the mutableStateListOf and toMutableStateList APIs.
* How to use ViewModel with Compose.


## The app has two main functionalities:

* A water counter to track your water intake.
* A list of wellness tasks to do throughout the day.
